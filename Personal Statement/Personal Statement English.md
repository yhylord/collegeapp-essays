To me, the Internet is not just virtual. It is real as it showcases what is best about human interactions and leads us to discover what is interesting about others.

I first realized this when my live commenting system was used at a performance. Within clicks, user comments were projected onto a screen for all to see before sliding away as newer comments took their place, giving teenagers a chance to demonstrate their brilliance and escape loneliness. I felt happy hearing the crowd’s cheerful responses to the performance onstage, as through my creation, audiences, who used to passively accept performances, became a part of them. With those texts, their voices reached others, which in turn sparked responses from their peers, so that we were no longer islands in the sea, but a network of voices and ideas, empowering the audience with the ability to ‘use’ the performance as a basis for deeper interactions with others.

The internet had previously benefited me in a similar manner. Learning to program from scratch, I stumbled upon a world of abundant resources, as enthusiasts shared everything they knew to help newcomers. Their passion and willingness to help others impressed me: all I had to do was ask, instead of struggling to debug or learn new concepts on my own. This inspired me to create the live commenting system to encourage others to connect, forming a positive feedback loop and establishing further connections within networks.

However, the larger reality often contradicts my experience. Under the banner of connecting the world, products of tech giants often weaken the connections between us. Our interactions become fragile and mechanical, and genuine emotions vanish. For instance, Google Photos has a feature called "Suggested Sharing." It can recommend photos to share and with whom, based on the people in them and your frequent contacts. Even better, it can automatically send photos to designated people. All you have to do is click a button. Seems handy, doesn't it? However, imagine receiving photos from a friend who uses this feature, do you still feel the same happiness knowing it could just be an unintentional click?. Likewise, do you still bother taking time to choose photos and recollect memories? This feature of Google Photos diminishes the meaning of sharing, degenerating it into the random noise of finger movements. It deprives users of their autonomy in making meaningful connections to others.

As someone who grew up in the internet age, and who has benefited so much from it, I'm unwilling to see technology diminish the connections between people. Instead, I want to preserve what’s best about it and build on its ability to offer users a highly customized, personalized experience that would heighten what we treasure most about human interactions, instead of bringing out the automaton in them. To do so, I created a personalized reading app that provides high-quality articles from Zhihu, a popular social Q&A website, which enables users to access the content most relevant to them in the least amount of time. Readers can discover their favorite authors and subscribe to their articles, gaining a stable source for reading without the hassle. It connects them to others who share their passion, and brings them in contact with their better parts, stimulating their intellect and drawing out their unique strengths. Through discovering authentic selves, people can defy the threats of technology because we can be immune to being copied and replaced by machines. Understanding the distinction between us and machines helps us utilize them rather than giving in to them. We will better appreciate our place in this technological world, and we will reach out others more sincerely in the hope of absorbing new ideas that enhance our unique traits. At the end, I hope to contribute to a loop of enriching ourselves through initiating genuine interactions, and we will prove our resilience to the shock of emerging technology, by turning it into a force that better unites us.
