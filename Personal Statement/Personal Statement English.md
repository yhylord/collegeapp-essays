To me, the Internet is not virtual. It is so real that it reorganizes the structure of our interactions. It leads us to discover more interesting souls. I first realized this when my live comment system joined the Christmas eve performance. In my system, within clicks, users' comments are posted on the big projection screen and stay there for a while as they slide away. That night, floods of comments hit the screen and dominated it, as young minds who can't stand loneliness radiate their excitement. These who were wrapped in darkness finally got a chance to show their brilliance. I always felt happy to hear giggles and see new comments popping out, all echoing a funny line. Not only because I enjoyed that line as well, but also because I confirmed that I did something good: through my creation, audiences, who used to passively accept performances, became part of them. With those tiny texts, they could reach out others, who in turn found spark in their peers, strong connections forming between them. In a nutshell, I empowered them.
