The Internet is not a virtual world to me. It is real as it encourages our curiosity to know better ideas, and our passion for sharing valuable thoughts. How can I reveal this fantastic quality to as many people as possible?

Spreading the ideal to my schoolmates should be easy enough, so I targeted a school performance, enhancing its experience by extending it to the cyberspace. My live commenting system projected user comments onto a screen for all to see, before sliding away as newer comments took their place. The teenagers at the show responded enthusiastically to the new feature. Creative responses to the performance onstage amused audiences, who were inspired to express their feelings. This instant interaction among the audience became another big show of the night, whose actors were all of us. I felt happy that my work acted as an outlet for voices more powerful than those amplified by microphones. My friends told me that they felt liberated when sharing their reactions with the whole hall, and satisfied by timely humor they could never imagine. The free exchange of meaningful ideas, without the wall of space and time, is indeed what we want.

The Internet had previously benefited me in a similar manner. Learning to program from scratch, I stumbled upon a world of abundant resources, as enthusiasts shared everything they knew to help newcomers. All I had to do was ask, instead of struggling on my own. Later, when I gained some experience, I began helping others that were in my original position. The community, united by a common goal of democratizing programming, was reciprocal and egalitarian: everyone could benefit from contributions, and contribute to benefits. The same spirit of mutuality transferred to my creation. The screen was bursting with whimsical thoughts, and a new comment could lead to several following ones, which formed a cycle that incorporated more and more voices. My efforts were paid off, as I strengthened the belief of a positive Internet for many individuals surrounding me.

However, when examining the larger reality, I was disappointed to see that more turned to the opponents of new technology. Sadly, based on the same notion of building more connections, social media evolved into a foundation for fake news, sowing distruct among citizens and broadening the gap between voices. It satisfied curiosity about conspiracy and fostered baseless attacks toward each other. Was I fundamentally wrong believing that the Internet could promote valuable conversation among the majority of us?

"I hope as world history students, you won't be surprised that James Watt didn't invent the steam engine," Mr. Wilson's voice awoke me. As usual, he started the class by history-related jokes that sparked laughter. "So why was he still considered an important figure? Because he was the one who made it practical to apply steam power to almost everywhere. In the history of technology, the wider range of people who can utilize it, the more appreciated a technology is."

Inspired, I realized that I limited the scope of my work before I could try to extend it. Yes, now only small communities had shown to sustain positive interactions, but it did not imply that I could not bring similar experience to larger ones! To counter the divisive effect of social media on society as a whole, I need a solution that could address the entirety of citizens as well. If social networks apply technology to create division by meeting user biases, I can apply technology for the opposite. Therefore, I have initiated a personalized reading service that supplies evidence-based and informative writing. This kind of writing, with less biases, can supplement critical thinking with reliable sources. Incorporating topics from climate change to social welfare, the service can attract a diversity of focuses. The project's unique goal may surpass the borders of different opinions by incorporating them into constructive discussions, and its diverse user base, broader than any of my former attempts, will truly show the inspiring side of the Internet in an egalitarian way.
