To me, the Internet is not just virtual. It is real.

I first realized this when my live commenting system was used at a performance. Within clicks, user comments were projected onto a screen for all to see before sliding away as newer comments took their place, giving teenagers a chance to express themselves. I felt happy hearing the crowd’s cheerful responses as through my creation, audiences, who used to passively watch performances, became a part of them. With those texts, users with different interests and thoughts could participate in the endless stream of comments, and a network of diverse connections that was easily accessible was being formed. Technology can and should bring the ideas, thoughts, and feelings that form the basis of singular interactions into a network of multiple interactions. Designing a 'live' commenting system is not only about promoting participation, but is an example of network formation.

At the same time, I noticed plenty of unkind comments. Some of the audience went overboard with their jokes, posting vulgar and crass comments on screen, which soured the atmosphere and was disrespectful to the performers on stage. It made me realize that I had to use technology to manage the flow of information. Clear regulatory frameworks were needed in order to ensure friendly and meaningful interactions within the web of voices and ideas.

It was precisely a friendly and helpful online culture that got me started on my programming journey. Learning to program from scratch, I stumbled upon a world of abundant resources on a popular online Q&A community called Zhihu. Enthusiasts shared everything they knew to help newcomers. Their passion and willingness to help others enabled me to discover a web of knowledge and interesting ideas that was readily accessible, even if I had not known to ask the right questions.

As someone who grew up in the internet age, and who has benefited so much from it, I do not wish to see poor information management diminish the connections and efficiency of the web of knowledge and ideas. At Zhihu, and other Q&A fora, low-quality information flows and weak search capabilities clutter an environment that does not encourage valuable and effective interactions. The top-ranked results are often copied and users often fail to have access to the most reliable information. Where previously users visited these sites for varied purposes, to ask all sorts of questions under the sun, this freedom of participation had been diminished through poor management. Inefficient navigation through the network is characterized by redundant connections and duplicate questions. More importantly, users are frustrated by the tedious search for useful information and it dampens their desire to participate. Consequently, the network's ability to provide the best of collective wisdom deteriorates.

I want to correct these flaws and preserve what’s best about it to offer users a highly customized experience within an enhanced and well-managed web structure where people can efficiently access information from fields they might not be familiar with.

As a start, I have created a personalized reading app that provides high-quality articles from Zhihu, which enables users to access the content most relevant to them in the least amount of time. Readers can discover their favorite authors and subscribe to their articles, gaining a stable source for reading without the hassle. It connects them to others who share their passion, stimulates their intellect and draws out their unique strengths. By deliberately keeping the range of article topics wide, it respects the pursuit of different interests and enhances it by presenting the most valuable content. I hope to contribute to a positive feedback loop of self-enrichment through a network that encourages meaningful and fruitful dialogue, and that helps us to better appreciate our place in this technological world. Through the network, we can remain connected yet retain our individual strengths, thereby simultaneously uniting all users while enjoying the benefits of individual agency.
