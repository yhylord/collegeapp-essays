The Internet is not a virtual world to me. It is real as it encourages our curiosity to know better ideas, and our passion for sharing valuable thoughts. How can I reveal this fantastic quality to as many people as possible?

The first attempt was enhancing the experience of a school performance by extending it to the cyberspace. My live commenting system projected user comments onto a screen for all to see, before sliding away as newer comments took their place. The teenagers at the show responded enthusiastically to the new feature. Creative responses to the performance onstage amused audiences, who were inspired to express their feelings. This instant interaction among the audience became another big show of the night, whose actors were all of us. I felt happy that my work acted as an outlet for voices more powerful than those amplified by microphones. My friends told me that they felt liberated when sharing their reactions with the whole hall, and satisfied by timely humor they could never imagine. The free exchange of meaningful ideas, without the wall of space and time, is indeed what we want.

The Internet had previously benefited me in a similar manner. Learning to program from scratch, I stumbled upon a world of abundant resources, as enthusiasts shared everything they knew to help newcomers. All I had to do was ask, instead of struggling on my own. Later, when I gained some experience, I began helping others that were in my original position. The community, united by a common goal of democratizing programming, was reciprocal and egalitarian: everyone could benefit from contributions, and contribute to benefits. I incorporated the same spirit of mutuality in the live commenting system that brought out the best of ourselves, knowing that all of us would enjoy. Seeing the success among my peers excited me; more people were on my side now, who could passionately tell the transformative effect of the Internet.

However, when examining the larger reality, I was disappointed to see that more people turned to the opponents of new technology. Their reasons were at odds with mine, yet I could not say they were wrong. I was saddened to see social media became a foundation for fake news, sowing distruct among citizens and broadening the gap between opinions. It satisfied curiosity about conspiracy and fostered baseless attacks toward each other. Was I fundamentally wrong believing that the Internet could promote valuable conversation among the majority of people? Maybe that could only happen in a small circle, such as programmers or my peers at school, where fruitful connections would emerge naturally, with or without the Internet? "How could I do something that really matters?" I kept contemplating about it.

"I hope as world history students, you won't be surprised that James Watt didn't invent the steam engine," Mr. Wilson's voice awoke me. As usual, he started the class by history-related jokes that sparked laughter. "So why was he still considered an important figure? Because he was the one who made it practical to apply steam power to almost everywhere. In the history of technology, the wider range of people who can utilize it, the more appreciated a technology is."

Inspired, I realized that I limited the scope of my work before I could try to extend it. Yes, now only small communities had shown to sustain positive interactions, but it did not imply that I could not bring similar experience to larger ones! I have begun considering common demands that stemmed from users of diverse backgrounds. On Zhihu, a popular Q&A website that has tens of millions of users, its content discovery mechanism favors clickbait, often filled with strong biases. Intellectual readers cannot easily find in-depth and neutral content, and its writers desperately need a channel for broadcasting their writing. Maybe I can build a platform to connect their needs? With this objective, I initiated a personalized reading service that supplies evidence-based and informative writing from Zhihu. Although still at its alpha stage, it has a vision that surpasses all of my former ones: to encourage independent thinking that can transcend the boundary of different circles. I realize that to save my world from falling apart, I cannot only try to save a part of it. Its parts must stay connected as a whole, just like what the Internet intends to be: a world that connects the best of us.
