To me, the Internet is not virtual. It is so real that it reorganizes the structure of our interactions. It leads us to discover more interesting souls. I first realized this when my live comment system joined the Christmas eve performance. In the system, within clicks, users' comments are uploaded, posted on the big projection screen, and stayed there for a while as they slide away. That night, floods of comments hit the screen and dominated it, as young spirits who can't stand loneliness radiate their excitement. These who were wrapped in darkness finally got a chance to show their brilliance. I always felt happy to hear giggles and see new comments popping out, all echoing a funny line. Not only because I enjoyed that line as well, but also because I confirmed that I did something good: through my creation, audiences, who used to passively accept performances, became part of them. With those tiny texts, their voices reached to others, who in turn found spark in their peers, strong connections forming between them. In a nutshell, I empowered them.

I had this experience before too, the experience of forming active, positive connections to others through the Internet. Learning programming from scratch, I stumbled upon a world of abundant resources, as enthusiasts shared everything they knew to help newcomers. Their passion and willingness to help others impressed me, and they let me know that I could always realize my fuller potential. All I had to do was to believe in and initiate connections to others. Perhaps due to this realization, I created the live comment system in turn, in the hope of letting more connect to others. Technology connected me to technology, which then enabled me to benefit others. It seemed to be a positive loop driven by the network.

However, the reality often contradicts with my experience. Under the banner of connecting the world, products of tech giants often instead weaken the connections between us. Our interactions become fragile and mechanical, and genuine emotions vanish. For instance, Google Photos has a feature called "Suggested Sharing." It can recommend which photos to share and with whom, based on who is in them and who you often contact. Or even better, it can automatically send photos to designated people. All you have to do is to click a button. Seems handy, isn't it? However, this time-saver can "save" a meaningful relationship too. Imagine you receiving photos from a friend. Knowing him/her using Google Photos and the feature, do you still feel the usual happiness of being noticed and cared about? It could be just an unintentional click anyway. The same goes for you who sends the photos. Do you still bother to waste time on choosing photos and recollecting the good old feelings? Do you care so much about the person, or just feel boring? It's just a click anyway. Clearly, Google nullifies the meaning of sharing, degenerating into random noises of finger movements. It deprives users of their autonomy in making meaningful connections to others.

I'm unwilling to see technology destroys connections between people, since I fell in love with it for the exact opposite. To save my faith in it, I set off in a different direction from that of Google, by creating a personalized reading project that provides high-quality articles from Zhihu, a popular social Q&A website. I hope my users can connect to the best content in the least amount of time, and use the saved time to develop connections with their loved ones, rather than being addicted to the site. It is also about preserving my belief in the positiveness, and I'm willing to take this small step against the massive force of some tech giants. And I know other people who are taking similar steps. Connected, we can have real impact on the Internet, preserving it as the hub of genuine connections.
