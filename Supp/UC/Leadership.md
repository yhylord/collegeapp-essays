My school, as a microcosm of society, similarly suffers from technological inequality. Individuals that are exposed to computer science at an early age explore the field with the massive amount of resources they already possess and build essential skills that will benefit them for their lifetime. Many believe that the ‘magic’ of programming is only for the "smartest kids" and hesitate to explore a field that is open to everyone.

At the programming club, we value equality and believe technology should not be a privilege reserved for a few. Therefore, one of our missions is to encourage participation in computer science activities, and as the club's president and ambassador, I raise awareness and engage people to join our activities. I can be a persuasive writer who uses analogy, statistics, and humor to bridge the gap between the computer world and the larger world. In January, to introduce the Canadian Computing Contest, I wrote an announcement that went viral. The post started by mocking the dull and uninformative official announcement from last year: why would anyone join the contest after reading it?

As most contestants would be AP Computer Science students, I pointed out the contest's reasonable difficulty by showing the similarity between past problems and AP CS ones. In the past year, an absolute majority of contestants received awards, and I included this statistic as an incentive. Throughout the article, I repeatedly wrote, "If you feel convinced, don't wait and text \[phone number\] NOW!" which parodied a well-known shopping ad and demonstrated our eagerness. Non-CS students were amused, and even more CS students joined the contest, despite the CS class size being a third that of the previous year’s.

The post-contest feedback was positive: contestants found the joy of writing programs that solved interesting problems, and participating in the contest dispelled the myth that programming was mundane. Leadership is about appealing to different groups of people by addressing their concerns and providing effective incentives. I believe these skills will enable me to contribute to any group whose mission resonates with me.
