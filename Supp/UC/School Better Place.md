**Prompt**: What have you done to make your school or your community a better place? _(350 words maximum)_

I have consistently employed technology for enhancing the connections within our school. I realized this when my live commenting system was first used at the 2015 Christmas eve performance. Within clicks, user comments were projected onto a screen for all to see before sliding away as newer comments took their place, giving teenagers a chance to demonstrate their brilliance and escape loneliness. I felt happy hearing the crowd’s cheerful responses to the performance onstage, as through my creation, audiences, who used to passively accept performances, became a part of them. With those texts, their voices reached others, which in turn sparked responses from their peers, so that we were no longer islands in the sea, but a network of voices and ideas, empowering the audience with the ability to ‘use’ the performance as a basis for deeper interactions with others.

In the second year, we wanted to spread the system's impact beyond the current student body. Since the Christmas eve performance was also a homecoming event, we decided to let those alumni who could not return feel home by live streaming the performance with the system. To announce and finance the project, we launched a crowdsourcing campaign that attracted anticipations and donations from alumni. On the eve, over 200 alumni from four countries viewed the live stream, and many of them expressed their surprise and joy of immersing into the performance even if they were thousands of miles away. As international students, some of them stayed on campus while their peers reunited with their families. I was glad that our project provided a sense of relief by connecting them to where they came from. The dim light on their screens offered warmth reminiscing of the past that surpassed distance and overcame loneliness.

The Internet is amazing that it is not just virtual. It is real as it connects us to the best of others and the best of the past. I value this transformative quality of the Internet, and I am dedicated to realize it within my school.
