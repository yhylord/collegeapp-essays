**Prompt**: What have you done to make your school or your community a better place? _(350 words maximum)_

I have consistently employed technology to enhance the relationships and connections in our school, most clearly when my live commenting system was first used at the 2015 Christmas Eve performance. Within clicks, user sent comments onto a screen for all to see before sliding away as newer comments took their place, giving teenagers a chance to demonstrate their wit and escape loneliness. I felt happy hearing the crowd’s cheerful responses to the performance onstage, as through my creation, audiences, who used to passively watch performances, participated in them. With those texts, their voices reached others, which in turn sparked responses from their peers, so that we were no longer islands in the sea, but a network of voices and ideas, empowering the audience with the ability to ‘use’ the performance as a basis for deeper interactions with others.

In the second year, we wanted to extend our developed system's impact beyond the current student body. The Christmas Eve performance was also a homecoming event, but many alumni could not return, so we decided to live stream the performance with the system. On Christmas Eve, over 200 alumni from four countries viewed the live stream, and many of them expressed their surprise and joy of immersing themselves in the performance though they were thousands of miles away. As international students, some of them stayed on campus alone while their peers reunited with their families. I was glad our project gave them a sense of home and belonging. The dim light on their screens offered warmth reminiscing a past that continued into the present, overcoming distance and loneliness.

The Internet is not just virtual. It is real as it connects us to the best of others and the best of our things. This valuable transformative quality is prevailing throughout the connected world and my community should be no exception. Therefore, I am dedicated to realizing it on campus and beyond, building tight-knit communities that can contribute to the larger world.
