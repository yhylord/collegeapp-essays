Learning to program from scratch, I stumbled upon a world of abundant resources, as enthusiasts shared everything they knew to help newcomers. Their passion and willingness to help others impressed me: all I had to do was ask, instead of struggling to debug or learn new concepts on my own. This inspired me to create the live commenting system that displayed real-time reactions to events, which encouraged others to connect, forming a positive feedback loop and establishing further connections within networks.

However, as I explore the realm of technology and evaluate its impact using critical thinking, I find the larger reality often contradicts my experience. Under the banner of connecting the world, products of tech giants often weaken the connections between us. For instance, Google Photos has a feature called "Suggested Sharing." It can recommend photos to share and with whom and even automatically send photos to designated people. All come with clicking a button. Handy, right? However, imagine receiving photos from a friend who uses this feature, do you still feel the same happiness knowing it could just be an unintentional click? Likewise, do you still bother taking time to choose photos and recollect memories? This feature of Google Photos diminishes the meaning of sharing, degenerating it into the random noise of finger movements. It deprives users of their autonomy in making meaningful connections to others.

I'm unwilling to see technology diminish the connections between people. Instead, I want to offer users a highly customized, personalized experience that would heighten what we treasure most about human interactions. Therfore, I created a personalized reading app that provides high-quality articles from Zhihu, a popular social Q&A website, which enables users to access the content most relevant to them in the least amount of time. It connects them to others who share their passion, and brings them in contact with their better parts, stimulating their intellect and drawing out their unique strengths and qualities. Additionally, they can redirect their time savings to the offline world, developing more stable and meaningful connections with their significant ones.
