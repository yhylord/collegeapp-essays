**Prompt**: Please submit a _one page, single-spaced (approx. 600 words)_ essay that explains why you have chosen Carnegie Mellon and your particular _major(s), department(s) or program(s)_. This essay should include the reasons why you've chosen the major(s), _any goals or relevant work plans_ and any other information you would like us to know. For freshmen applying to more than one college or program, please mention each college or program to which you are applying. Because our admission committees review applicants by college and program, your essay can impact our final decision. Candidates applying for early decision or transfer may apply to only one college and department.

CMU's vision, mission, and strategic plans mark the school as unconventional in its cutting-edge education and research that foster transformative impact. As an advocate for benefiting humanity with technology and a programmer, I created a personalized reading service that boosts access to high-quality articles found on social media. To improve its effectiveness, I will require a higher proficiency in theoretical and practical computer science, and, equally important, a comprehensive understanding of its broader implications, all of which are provided by CMU, especially its School of Computer Science. These qualities can prepare me to be more than just another programming whiz, but to be a modern specialist with a rounded perspective.

The key to a successful CS career is a deep understanding of CS theories that would support their effective applications. The CS core would build this essential foundation for me with its emphasis on rigorous theoretical learning aimed at improving practical solutions. The depth of the core curriculum is unparalleled, as it is one of the few that designates functional programming as mandatory for undergraduates. In "Principles of Functional Programming," the elegant programming paradigm I learn will enable me to write correct programs with right abstractions that are highly scalable. The course will be a powerful tool in my toolbox, which, through the completion of other core courses, can become versatile and adaptable to various contexts.

A skillful programmer might still find it difficult selecting the best arena for his abilities. Fortunately, SCS offers courses that allow experimentation with applications in different areas. Prizing innovation, it offers "Applied Machine Learning," a course highly relevant to my project, as I can apply cutting-edge approaches to text processing, text categorization, and information retrieval, as well as the methodology for systematic performance evaluations. The deepened understanding of the interaction between machine learning and its applications would support the evolution of my project and strengthen its robustness. Many other courses similarly provide opportunities to approach various real-life problems through novel methods. The intensive exposure to the implementation of technological solutions offers valuable insight into the practical side of computer science that would aid my future study and career in this field.

However, I realize that problem solving involves aspects beyond the technological alone. Effective problem solvers should equip themselves with a holistic framework that leads to questions that matter and justifies solutions based on a careful investigation of their social and philosophical implications. A promoter of this essential quality, CMU encourages its students to critically reflect on the impact of their disciplinary knowledge by offering interdisciplinary courses at Dietrich College. In "Computing, AI, and Philosophy," a course that blends philosophy and sociology with computer science, I would gain a comprehensive understanding of the power of computation and issues arising from it. Viewing this subject dialectically lets me identify my possible bias as a technologist and will allow me to ask the right questions and develop effective and ethical solutions.

These components of my academic experience will aid me in contributing to the strategic plans, which is a chance for me to transform society beyond the border of the campus via my skills. The objectives of the Simon Initiative appeal to me especially, as it strives to trigger a paradigm shift in education. Enthralled by the vision's courage to initiate a revolution, I hope to join the LearnLab, a flagship project of the Simon Initiative, and modernize current educational methodology by innovating next-generation products that would eliminate out-of-date didactic methods. My efforts would resonate with CMU's vision of having "a transformative impact on society" that is theory-based, practical, and comprehensive.
