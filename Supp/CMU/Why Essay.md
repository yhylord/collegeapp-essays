**Prompt**: Please submit a _one page, single-spaced (approx. 600 words)_ essay that explains why you have chosen Carnegie Mellon and your particular _major(s), department(s) or program(s)_. This essay should include the reasons why you've chosen the major(s), _any goals or relevant work plans_ and any other information you would like us to know. For freshmen applying to more than one college or program, please mention each college or program to which you are applying. Because our admission committees review applicants by college and program, your essay can impact our final decision. Candidates applying for early decision or transfer may apply to only one college and department.
