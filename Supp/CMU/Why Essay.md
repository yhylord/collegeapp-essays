**Prompt**: Please submit a _one page, single-spaced (approx. 600 words)_ essay that explains why you have chosen Carnegie Mellon and your particular _major(s), department(s) or program(s)_. This essay should include the reasons why you've chosen the major(s), _any goals or relevant work plans_ and any other information you would like us to know. For freshmen applying to more than one college or program, please mention each college or program to which you are applying. Because our admission committees review applicants by college and program, your essay can impact our final decision. Candidates applying for early decision or transfer may apply to only one college and department.

CMU's vision, mission, and strategic plans mark the school as an unconventional flagship of cutting-edge education and research that foster transformative impacts. As an advocate for benefiting humanity with technology as well as a programmer, I have created a personalized reading service that boosts the access to high-quality articles found on social media. However, to improve its effectiveness will require a higher proficiency in theoretical and practical computer science, and, equally important, a comprehensive understanding of its broader implications, all of which are provided by CMU, especially by its School of Computer Science. These qualities can prepare me not merely as yet another better programmer, but as a modern specialist with a rounded perspective.

The key to a successful CS career is a deep understanding of CS theories that would support their effective applications. The CS core would build this essential foundation for me with its emphasis on rigorous theoretical learning aiming at improving practical solutions. The depth of the core curriculum is unparalleled, as it is one of the few that designates functional programming as mandatory for its undergraduates to understand. In "Principles of Functional Programming," I could learn this elegant programming paradigm that enables me to write correct programs with right abstractions that are highly scalable. The course can add a powerful tool to my toolbox, which, through the completion of other core courses as well, can become versatile and adaptable to various contexts.

A skillful programmer can still find it hard to find the field for his ability. Fortunately, SCS offers courses that allow experimentation with applications in different areas. As an innovative college, it offers "Applied Machine Learning," a course highly relevant to my project, in which I could apply the cutting-edge approach to text processing, text categorization, and information retrieval, as well as the methodology for systematic evalutaions of performance. The deepened understanding of the interaction between machine learning and its applications would support the evolution of my project and strengthen its robustness. Many other courses similarly provide opportunities to approach various real-life problems by practicing novel methods. The intensive exposure to the implementation of technological solutions offers valuable insight into the practical side of computer science that would aid my future study or career in this field.

However, I realize that problem-solving requires multiple dimensions beyond technology alone. Effective problem-solvers should equip themselves with a holistic framework that leads to questions that matter and justifies solutions based on a careful investigation of their social and philosophical implications. A promoter of this essential quality, CMU encourages its students to critically reflect on the impact of their disciplinary knowledge by offering interdisciplinary courses at the Dietrich College. In "Computing, AI, and Philosophy," a course that blends philosophy and sociology with computer science, I would gain a comprehensive point of view regarding the power of computation and issues arising from it. Viewing this subject dialectically lets me identify my possible bias as a technologist and will allow me to ask the right questions and develop proper solutions.

With these components, my academic experience can culminate in contributing to the strategic plans, which is a chance for me to transform the society beyond the border of the campus via my skills. The objectives of the Simon Initiative especially appeal to me, as it strives to trigger a paradigm shift in education. Enthralled by the vision's courage to initiate a revolution, I would join the LearnLab, a flagship project of the Simon Initiative, and modernize the current educational methodology by innovating next-generation products that would eliminate out-of-date didactic methods. My efforts would resonate with CMU's vision as having "a transformative impact on society" that would be theory-based, practical, and comprehensive.
