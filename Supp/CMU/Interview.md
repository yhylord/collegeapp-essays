I had a pleasant interview on Nov. 4 with Mr. Zeyang Li (SCS '10). Zeyang is the co-founder of ChillyRoom, a game startup that has won recognitions both in China and in the oversea. The conversation with Zeyang reaffirmed my belief that CMU prepared students as future leaders by providing a versatile skillset through rigorous, interdisciplinary academics.

According to Zeyang, his research opportunity in the School of Computer Science allowed continuous learning for his career. In his undergraduate years, he received a research opportunity just by reaching out to his computer graphics professor and authored an original student paper. Though not a researcher anymore, Zeyang said the skill of reading literature enabled him to follow the latest trends in the academia and apply cutting-edge research outcomes on computer graphics to his games. His experience of effective learning through research was something I could attest to. When conducting computational quantum chemistry research on supercapacitors, I was exposed to knowledge far beyond the high school curriculum, such as quantum mechanics and parallel data processing. Though producing different outcomes, our research experiences both illuminated that learning by research was powerful for acquiring new knowledge. Therefore, I was delighted to learn about the availability of research opportunities at SCS, which, according to Zeyang, meant that virtually anyone with a liable new idea could be a researcher. I could continue exploring any fields of computer science under faculty mentorship. I plan to research under Professor Yiming Yang on the BIGDATA project that utilizes heteregeneous information for making recommendations that consider users' contexts, which can substantially my project's effectiveness.

Apart from computer science, Zeyang told me that he obtained an Art minor at CMU that had become his core competency, reflecting CMU's interdisciplinary focus. A long time gamer, he would like to acquire artistic skills that would transform him from a game player into a game creator. CMU's offering was unique and attractive for him, since it was (and is) one of the few schools that was high-ranked in both art programs and computer science programs. Though Zeyang did not create the art for his games, his experience of art helped him recruit the artists in his team and coordinate with them. He believed that well-rounded experts were crucial to startups that could only support a handful of employees, and his talents at both CS and art really made him stand out as a leader. I have been thinking how structual elements like design influence user experience, and, following his words, I am glad to find that the intersection of CS and design naturally occurs at CMU. I look forward to enrolling in the "Programming Usable Interfaces" course, in which I can learn the iterative design cycle of user interfaces using user feedbacks. Having completed the course, I could deliver an more user-friendly user interface that encourages activity on my personalized reading service, which can increase the project's impact.

Zeyang also informed me how the atmosphere at CMU built his professional values. During his undergraduate years, he was constantly surrounded by dedicated people, characterized by the school motto "my heart is in the work." When taking demanding upper-level courses such as operation system and compiler, he struggled to complete the coursework. He appreciated his dedication at the time, which gave him confidence in solving any technical problems occurred in his career. It was inspirational to hear that the four years at CMU could have an ever-lasting impact that gifted him with a fearless leadership. Joining the CMU community, I hope to advance learning science, a key subject from CMU's strategic recommendations with the interdisciplinary fusion of expertise - psychology, decision science, compute science and more - and realize the university's mission of transforming the future by collaborating with brilliant minds.
