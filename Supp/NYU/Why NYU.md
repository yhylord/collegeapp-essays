**Prompt**: We would like to know more about your interest in NYU. We are particularly interested in knowing what motivated you to apply to NYU and more specifically, why you have applied or expressed interest in a particular campus, school, college, program, and/or area of study? Ifyou have applied to more than one, please tell us why you are interested in each of the campuses, schools, colleges, or programs to which you have applied. You may be focused or undecided, or simply open to the options within NYU's global network; regardless, we want to understand - Why NYU? (*400 word* maximum)

NYU's borderless campus reflects its ideal of a borderless education. As a programmer who advocates for technology that benefits humanity, I seek to understand technology's influence on society and to use it for meaningful ends. NYU's excellence in its breadth of academic offerings and its active outreach, can equip to me be an effective problem solver of real-world challenges.

Working closely with the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the computer science program offers theoretical courses that form a firm foundation for practical application. A step towards creating positive impact with programming, my personalized reading project empowers readers to find high-quality articles with ease. It helps users by prioritizing excellent writing that matches their interests. To improve on user experience, Iâ€™d need a deeper theoretical understanding of machine learning. "Introduction to Machine Learning" would provide me just that with its introductory overview of machine learning algorithms. With it, I can assess the effectiveness of different techniques and apply those that match my project's needs. The result will be a more robust service that can serve a more diverse user base.

NYU will also provide me with the opportunity to explore the big questions on the relationship between technology and humanity. Since I started my project, I have been wondering: If a computer program can make intelligent and customized reading recommendations tailored to human needs, does it then acquire a human-like intelligence? If so, what does it mean for us humans, who have defined ourselves primarily by our "unique" brand of intelligence? An approach to an answer can be found in "Minds and Machines", offered by NYU's world-class philosophy department. After completing the course, I will better understand technology's role in human society and take a user-oriented approach in my future work.

With the right skillset and mindset, I can begin to contribute in practical ways by engaging with the public. I am especially interested in joining hackNY, whose mission include serving underserved communities by using technical skills. By serving those who need help, I can extend the aim and scope of my project - that equality of access to information matters. Active involvement serving underprivileged communities will not only give me a valuable and meaningful experience necessary for a fruitful career in computer science, but also realize my vision of technology for positive social impact.
