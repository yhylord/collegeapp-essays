My friends and I set up a live stream for our school’s homecoming event that provided 200 alumni from 4 countries the opportunity to interact through a live commenting system that projected comments from all attendees (whether virtual or physical) on a screen. To finance this, we launched a crowdfunding campaign that provided us with funds for a camera and networking devices, and to have excess for future activities. This project while successful was hastily executed, and anxiety over funds prevented us from giving our work the single-minded attention we would have liked. Georgia Tech’s support for entrepreneurship with groups like CREATE-X would give me a structured yet dynamic environment to test and execute my ideas systematically, rapidly develop prototypes and form practical go-to-market strategies whilst adhering to a schedule. I would be able to focus on my ideas, giving it the attention it needs, while cultivating necessary business skills.
