I wished my dad could get fired. A former engineer in a telecommunications equipment company, he has another family called work, with which he spends more time than with my mom and I. I always remember that after a family TV night, he would answer a call, sigh deeply, and then dress up his business outfit and pick up his briefcase. "Something broke down on one of our sites, gonna see if things can work out," he said, with a slam of the front door. In the late night, my mom would awaken to another slam of the door, when my dad returned home. He would proudly announce that he saved the company for the trouble, while mom would protest, "Don't you know I can't bear any sound while sleeping! Not to say a slam!" "Well, in our industry, when a trouble happens, you just never sleep before your users do." Because he could only repair equipments when all users went inactive, he always explained. His off-topic defense further made his job seem less than ideal for me; a job that took over family was not for me, I thought.

Yet my dad, a veteran engineer, has engineering wisdom that saved me, a reckless programmer.

"Your team screwed up! My friend's email account got hacked!" The abrupt message became terrifying when another message from my team member popped up, "Did you release all the real passwords?" For an upcoming on-campus event, we at the programming club were trying to ensure that every student could log into our system. We usually released their initial passwords, random four-digit numbers that were assigned upon registrations, that could be used for resetting passwords. It had not caused any problems, until that evening. I posted users' current passwords.

I was shocked by my stupidity. As the president of the club, supposedly the most experienced one, I was acting like a complete newbie! How would people view me and my club after this? Thinking about the possible reactions from angry users, I fell into paralysis.

Avoiding facing the aftermath, I walked to and sat on the sofa. I sighed deeply, shaking my head and rubbing my forehead.

"What's wrong, son?" asked my dad worriedly.

Suddenly, I realized that an expert was sitting next to me. How lucky was I that my dad was free from work just on that day! I told him the accident. "I'm screwed, people will be mad at me. I really don't know what to do."

"Relax, son. Once when I was upgrading the equipments, something went wrong and they were down for hours. The company thought it was gonna lose millions of user profiles."

"What?" It startled me. "How were you not fired?"

"Because I recovered them." He grinned. "Because clients don't care about failures, if just once in a while. You still have to apologize, but what's more important is a solution. If you can convince them that everything is gonna be fine, you'll be OK."

"Although I guess they'll be mad at you for a while." He laughed. And I laughed, reassuringly, too.

I rushed to my laptop and posted an apology that emphasized our value of privacy and promised that we would upgrade the security of our system. But I still gave up a good sleep. At 4 AM, I woke up to implement a security mechanism that would allow no one to see the real passwords. They were now only in users' brains.

In the morning, when we were waiting for the elevator, my mom looked annoyed and asked: "Why did you stay up so late last night? I couldn't fall asleep again after you woke me up!" "I gotta fix our system when no one is using it, so nobody will be affected!" "No matter what that is, you still have school today! How are you gonna not fall asleep?"

"Well, when a trouble happens, you just never sleep before your users do." I said with a grin and looked at dad.

He was surprised. Happy. Excited. "Seems like we have the gene of engineers in this family!" He laughed and patted my shoulder.

I still wish my dad could get fired and have a more a normal job. But less so than before. I understand a bit more about my dad, that sometimes, engineers sacrifice a lot to mend their faults, even if that means giving up sleep or annoying a weak-nerved mom. However, to engineer a product is like to give birth to a child: we cannot abandon it right away, because we are responsible for its healthy growth. When it is not behaving well, we need to defend it first by apologizing to others, and then teach it the right thing when no one else is watching. I understand why my dad sometimes leaves my mom and I behind, because he has another family member to care for - an engineer's work.
