I wished my dad could get fired. An engineer in a telecommunications equipment company, he spends more time with his colleagues than with us. I always remember that after a family TV night, he would answer a call, sigh deeply, and then dress up his business outfit and pick up his briefcase. "It's already 11pm, where are you going?" "Something broke down on one of our sites, gonna see if things can work out," he said, with a slam of the front door. Several hours later, my mom would awaken to another slam of the door, when my dad returned home. During the week after that, he would proudly announce that he saved the company for the trouble, while mom would protest that he ruined her sleep and the following day. I did not appreciate his professional ethic either; suffering from sleep deprivation for work was the least favorable choice for me.

Yet sometimes, giving up sleep worths it, and professionalism is a valuable quality. I learned this fact after creating a security failure myself and fixing it with dad's wisdom. As the president of the programming club, I was preparing for the Voice of HFI, the school-wise singing contest. One of the features was using our voting system, in which each user corresponded to a real student, as to prevent double counting. Since many students forgot their passwords, we usually posted initial password sheets in each class' homeroom. However, that night, I "breached" our password base - I released users' current passwords! "Your team screwed up! My friend's email account got hacked!" The club's reputation was ruined by me! People would laugh at a rookie president like me! I was so shocked by what I did and felt paralyzed - anything would be too late. Wanting to escape from what I had done, I moved my sight away from the screen and gazed out of the room door. As usual, my dad was sitting on the sofa, looking at his phone.

I walked to the sofa and sat beside him, sighing deeply with a grave look.

"What's wrong, son?" My dad locked his phone and looked at me.

Oh, what was I thinking about! I ignored an expert that had lived with me for my whole life. I told him the accident. "I'm screwed, people will be mad at me. I really don't know what to do."

Surprisingly, my dad did not scold but smile at me. "Relax, son. Your dad was in much greater trouble once. It cost the company millions of RMB."

"What?" It startled me. "How were you not fired?"

"You are gonna be fired if you always make mistakes, but not one mistake," He calmly said. "Do you wanna know how I fixed it?"

I nodded rapidly. "It's easy. You always apologize to your clients first. But what's more important, you gonna convince them that you can fix it, so that similar things won't happen again. The thing is, you are gonna rebuild their trust in you. If they believe that you are trustworthy, you won't be punished as much as you thought you would."

"Although I guess they'll be mad at you for a while." He laughed. And I laughed, reassuringly, too.

I rushed to my laptop and posted an apology that emphasized our value of privacy and promised that we would upgrade the security of our system.

"Hey, people seem to be OK with us." I said to dad.

"I told you so!"

"Guess I can have a good sleep too night."

"You deserve it!"

But of course I did not sleep well. At 4 AM, I woke up when my alarm rang. Two hours later, I finished implementing a security mechanism on our database that would allow no one to see the real passwords. They were now only in users' brains.

In the morning, when we were waiting for the elevator, my mom looked annoyed and asked: "Why did you stay up so late last night? I couldn't fall asleep again after you woke me up!" "I had to fix a bug in our program, mom. I gotta stay up late night when no one is using it, so I can fix it without affecting anybody!" "But you still have classes today! How are you gonna not fall asleep?"

"Well, when a trouble happens, you just never sleep before your users do." I said with a grin and looked at dad.

He was surprised. Happy. Excited. "Seems like we have the gene of engineers in this family!" He laughed and patted my shoulder.

I still wish my dad could get fired and have a more a normal job. But less so than before. I understand a bit more about my dad, that sometimes, engineers sacrifice a lot to mend their faults, even if that means giving up sleep or annoying a weak-nerved mom. However, to engineer a product is like to give birth to a child: we cannot abandon it right away, because we are responsible for its healthy growth. When it is not behaving well, we need to defend it first by apologizing to others, and then teach it the right thing when no one else is watching. I understand why my dad sometimes leaves my mom and I behind, because he has another family member to care for - an engineer's work.
