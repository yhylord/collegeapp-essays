I used to wish my dad would get fired. A former engineer in a telecommunications equipment company, he has another family called work, with which he spends more time than with my mom and I. Often after our family TV nights, he would answer a call, sigh deeply, dress in his business outfit and pick up his briefcase. "Something broke down on one of our sites, Iâ€™m going to see if I can work things out," he would say, the door slaming behind then. Late at night, my mom would awaken to the another slam, when my dad returned home. In the days afterward, he would proudly announce that he had saved the company, while mom would protest, "Don't you know I can't bear any sound while sleeping! Not to say a slam!" "Well, in our industry, when trouble happens, you never sleep before your users do." Because he could only repair the equipment when all users were inactive. Listening to his defence, I thought a job that superceded family was just not for me.

Yet my dad, a veteran engineer, gave me, a reckless programmer some life-saving engineering wisdom.

"Your team screwed up! My friend's email account got hacked!" I barely recovered from this shocking message when yet another from my team member popped up, "Did you release all the real passwords?" For an upcoming event, we at the programming club were trying to ensure that every student could log on to our system. We usually released their initial passwords, random four-digit numbers that were assigned upon registration, that could be used for resetting password. It had not caused any problems, until that evening. I had accidentally posted the users' current passwords.

I was shocked by my stupidity. As the president of the club, supposedly the most experienced one, I was acting like a complete newbie! How would people view me and my club after this? Thinking about the possible reactions from angry users, I fell into paralysis.

Avoiding facing the aftermath, I walked to and fro, and finally sank on to the sofa, sighing deeply.

"What's wrong, son?" asked my dad.

Suddenly, I realized that an expert was sitting next to me. How lucky was I that my dad was free from work just on that day! I told him about my mistake. "I'm screwed, people will be mad and I really don't know what to do."

"Relax, son. Once when I was upgrading the equipment, something went wrong and it was down for hours. The company thought it was going to lose millions of user profiles."

"What?!" It startled me. "How were you not fired?"

"Because I recovered them." He grinned. "Clients don't care about failures, if it happens once in a blue moon. You still have to apologize, but what's more important is a solution. If you can convince them that everything is going to be fine, you'll be OK."

"Although I guess they'll be mad at you for a while." He laughed. And I laughed, reassured by his kind words of advice.

I rushed to my laptop and posted an apology that showed how much we valued privacy and promised that we would upgrade our system security. But my mind allowed no rest. At 4 AM, I woke up to implement a security mechanism that would allow no one to see the real passwords. They were now only in the users' brains.

In the morning, when we were waiting for the elevator, my mom looked annoyed and asked: "Why did you stay up so late last night? I couldn't fall asleep again after you woke me up!"

"Well, when trouble happens, you just never sleep before your users do." I said with a grin and looked at dad.

He was surprised and gratfied. "Seems like the engineering gene runs in this family!" He laughed and patted my shoulder.

I still wish my dad could get fired and have a more "normal" job. But less so than before. To engineer a product is like giving birth to a child: we cannot abandon it right away, because we are responsible for its healthy growth. When it is not behaving well, we need to defend it first by apologizing to others, and then teach it the right thing when no one else is watching. I understand why my dad sometimes leaves my mom and me behind, because he has another family member to care for - an engineer's work.
