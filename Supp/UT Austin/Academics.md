Taking AP World History gave me more than an A: it offered me a new framework of thinking. When we discussed the Industrial Revolution, we discovered how the change in lifestyle weakened family connections. Before, family in the countryside was the unit of production, where adults worked while staying with children. However, since the workplace shifted to factories, family members scattered around the urban areas of industrial cities in the day, while reuniting at night for a very limited time. I learned from the case that the rise of technology may mean the reduction of social connections.

Today, similar things occur, with the Industrial Revolution replaced by the Information Revolution. Centered around mobile apps, our interactions become fragile and mechanical, and genuine emotions vanish. For instance, Google Photos has a feature called "Suggested Sharing." It can share your best photos automatically with your friends. All you have to do is click a button. Seems handy, doesn't it? However, imagine receiving photos from a friend who uses this feature, do you still feel the same happiness knowing it could just be an unintentional click?. Likewise, do you still bother taking time to choose photos and recollect memories? This feature of Google Photos diminishes the meaning of sharing, degenerating it into the random noise of finger movements. It deprives users of their autonomy in making meaningful connections to others, in the same way capitalism deprives workers of their autonomy in production.

Perceiving the negative effects of technology prompts me to use it for the better; I initiated a personalized reading service that helps users find their favorite articles. Meanwhile, I realize that being programmers means more than knowing how to code; they must critically evaluate the impact of their work to create things that matter. My academics reflect my learning as a whole person: I not only earned an A in history, but also would earn an A for my life.
