Taking AP World History offered me a new framework of thinking. When we discussed the Industrial Revolution, we discovered how the change in lifestyle weakened family connections. Before, family in the countryside was the unit of production, where adults worked while staying with children. However, since the workplace shifted to factories, family members scattered around the urban areas of industrial cities in the day, while reuniting at night for a very limited time. I learned from the case that the rise of technology may lead to the reduction of social connections.

Drawing analogy between the Industrial Revolution and the Information Revolution, I notice that similar things happen today: tech giants, with their promise of connecting the world, often disrupt  meaningful social interactions; it is not a coincidence that the epidemic of loneliness sweeps teenagers under the dominance of social media.

I strive to counteract this phenomenon by using technology as a medium meaningful connections. My STEM courses prepared me for realizing my idea. In Advanced Calculus, roughly equivalent to sophomore math in college, I learned basic linear algebra and multivariable calculus. These subfields in mathematics underlie the theory of machine learning and enabled me to start learning the latter, which transformed into a personalized reading service that helps users find their favorite articles.

My excellence in social science and STEM and its contribution to my project make me realize that good programmers should be well-rounded. They must critically evaluate the impact of their potential work and have the ability to implement it. Creating things that matter requires not critical thinking, not programming ability, but both.
