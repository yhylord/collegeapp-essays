## Intro

Cornell's commitment to creating impact on important problems, by interweaving liberal arts tradition and technological solutions, distinguishes itself as the top choice for me. A socially-minded programmer, I've critically inquired the role of technology in society and created works that promote positive changes. At Cornell, I'll further explore the theoretical possibilities of technology and, with the support of its world-class computer science program and its promise of public engagement, transform my visions into considerable progress.

## STS

Discovered STS when I did a research project about the philosophy of science during 1450-1800, specifically about the scientific method and the impact of scientifc progress on religious beliefs.

So I'd like to continue studying the history of science in the period after the one of my study. "The History of Science in Europe: Newton to Darwin; Darwin to Einstein"

After I discovered the field, I found that my constant interest in analyzing the interaction between technology and society perfectly fits into the scope of STS.

### Live commenting system

One of the earliest users of a Chinese video website with live commenting, I participated in the evolution of a new subculture originated from this feature. With the growth of this subculture, users sometimes enjoy the overlay of comments more than the underlying video, which similarly happened when I incorporated the feature in a school performance.

So "Computing Cultures," in which I will learn how new forms of communications change our cultural values.

### AI

On the other hand, I have always viewed AI as a revolutionary force that drastically fuels societal changes for the better. However, cyberpunk works like "Ghost in the Shell" and "I, Robot" depict worlds in which AI contributes to greater inequality and injustice and prompt me to consider the ethical impacts of AI. My personalized reading project is the outcome of such reflection, a move to counter information asymmetry and biases. I hope to continue my interest by enrolling in "Ethical Issues in Intelligent Autonomous Systems" that will give me a foundation of analyzing how AI should behave in society that can lead to a more productive and egalitartian future.

## CS

After carefully examining the nature of technology, I want to create positive impact by learning and applying technology, specifically computer science.

At Cornell, I'd like to conduct research with Professor Lillian Lee on how the application of machine learning impacts the formation of opinions. My research will be focused on busting the "filter bubble," the phenomenon that recommendations made by algorithms can lead to isolated views or opinion bubbles. The outcome of this research can reinforce the effectiveness of my project in providing mediation between different views.

After completing such research, I would like my project to have broader impact. Cornell's tradition of public engagement makes it easy for me to create measurable impact with my project. Center for Transformative Action (CTA), an affiliated organization that supports system-changing project, has a vision that coincides with mine. With CTA's support, I can explore the possibilities of reducing inequalities with my project and gain a first-hand experience of real social impact.
