__Prompt__: Describe two or three of your current intellectual interests and why they are exciting to you. Why will Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences be the right environment in which to pursue your interests? (Please limit your response to _650 words_.)

Cornell impresses me as an explorer of big questions even with the first glance over its website. ~~From the practicality of online democracy to the interplay of climate change and the humanities, the university always engages with novel topics that carry the most relevance to our future.~~ Critically inquiring the role of technology in society and creating softwares as experiments of my thoughts, I explore my own big question: Does technology promote the pursuit of truth? With the Cornellian weave of historical discovery, technological inquiry, and practical impact, I will discover paths that might lead to a satisfying answer for my question.

Through the Science and Technology Studies (STS) program at Cornell, I will be able to examine the importance of technology regarding the progress of science. A research project about the history of science during the early modern period led me to the field. In the project, I explored how the rise of empiricism and the improvement of experimental technology facilitated the spread of new scientific outcomes. With results based on more detailed observations and with more accuracy when replicating studies, peer review became more feasible and scientists achieved consensus faster. I was thrilled to see that, even at the dawn of modern science, technical advancement already intertwined with the scientific approach to fundamental truth, a discovery that has solidified my belief in a "yes" to my question. Therefore, I will like to enroll in "The History of Science in Europe: Newton to Darwin; Darwin to Einstein" to continue my quest for analyzing the acceleration of science. The course, focused on the modern period, will give me an extended understanding of the development of experimental technology in shaping the modern science. The integrated historical knowledge of the interaction between technology and science will allow me to accurately examine the impact on the ability to search for truths in the advent of new 21st century technology.

Beyond science in the academia, STS would perfectly support my interest in analyzing the influence of technology on spreading important information in the civil society. A constant benefitter and practicer of information technology, I have always appreciated its contribution to a world with a more egalitarian access to information. However, in recent years, algorithms that intended to provide personalized user experience have created the "filter bubble" that has distorted the source of information, polarized opinions and threatened civic discourse. Such devastating effects have prompted me to act against them using the same power of technology, and my actions have transformed into a project that supplies evidence-based and informative writing with machine learning that serves as a foundation for constructive debate. With the help of  the course "Designing Technology for Social Impact", I will learn how the design decisions of a technology can inherently incorporate certain values that can produce lasting social influence, and how unconscious biases can hide in good intentions that lead to undesirable results. The inquiry of values embodied in technology will become an asset for me to design new technology that promotes the availability to authentic information.

With the deepened understanding of technology for important messages, I will further apply technology supported by Cornell's emphasis of practical impact and public outreach. To attract a larger user base, my personal project needs an improvement in its reading experience. Therefore, I would join the Cornell User Experience Design group, where I can discuss practices on designing an immersive reading experience and iterate it by collaborating with fellow members. Ready for real-life situations, my project will have a chance to win wider recognition with Cornell's support on public engagement. The Center for Transformative Action, an affiliated NGO, supports projects that tackle inequalities which include my program. Its connections to the local community can aid me to reach out disadvantaged people who will benefit the most from the access to high-quality, unbiased information. The opportunity will be the first step for me to transform theories into tangible impact, that will start from the community and end beyond the border of physical space.
