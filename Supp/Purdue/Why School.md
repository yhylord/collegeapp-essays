**Prompt**: How will opportunities at Purdue support your interests, both in and out of the classroom? (Respond in _100 words_ or fewer.)

Believing in programming for the better, I co-created a secure voting system, used in a school-wide contest, that prevents unfair automated voting. At Purdue's computer science program, I hope to further study the security of online systems that ensures fairness in the course "Computer Security." Furthermore, the voting system was a joint effort by me and other members of the programming club. I always find working with like-minded people to be pleasant and effective, and thus I would like to join the Computer Science Learning Community, where I can connect to other students both academically and socially.
