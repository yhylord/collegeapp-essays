One of the things we did at the programming club was setting up a live stream for the Christmas eve performance, the biggest event in my school that was also a homecoming time. Alumni at the performance were surprised to see the move toward the latest trend of technology. More importantly, those alumni not at the live show could immerse themselves in the atmosphere via the live stream and interact with the performance through our live comment system that projected their comments on a screen. This new experience attracted over two hundred alumni studying in four countries. To buy the necessary camera and networking devices, we launched a crowdfunding campaign on WeChat that gained donations from hundreds of alumni and parents. The live stream boosted my club's influence, expanded its areas of activity, and the remaining funds from the campaign supported future activities.
