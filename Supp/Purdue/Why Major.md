**Prompt**: Briefly discuss your reasons for pursuing the major you have selected. (Respond in _100 words_ or fewer.)

Purdue provides an extraordinary opportunity for an individualized computer science degree. An advocate for benefiting humanity with technology and programming, I have created a personalized reading service that boosts the access to high-quality articles found on social media. To improve its effectiveness would require an understanding of computer science in multiple areas. The CS program's Tracks system allows me to take courses according to my need. The combination of Database and Information Systems and Machine Intelligence Tracks, for example, would let me gain a comprehensive perspective on retrieving and processing massive data, which can improve my project's efficiency.
