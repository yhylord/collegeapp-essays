__Prompt__: How did you first learn about Rice University, and what motivated you to apply? (_250 word_ limit)

"Rice University. Rice - how down to earth, I can't live without it."

"Houston. As hot and humid as Guangzhou. Weather checked."

"'Unconventional Wisdom' ... I like the sound of that!"

These three initial impressions I had during the university's information session gave me a natural affinity with Rice, which grew clearer the more I learned about its academic programs and campus culture.

How does application essay writing benefit from programming experiences? How are stressed high school seniors similar to 19th century workers? These might seem like odd questions but they come naturally to a reflective individual who applies what he learns to his lived experience. As I go through the rites of application season, I derive pleasure and meaning viewing it through a variety of lenses.

Rice's open curriculum will nourish the full range of my intellectual curiosities and deepen my interactions with the world through its interdisciplinary academic programs. The tight-knit residential colleges will further complement this by bringing me into contact with fellow classmates from diverse backgrounds.

Further, Rice's collaborative atmosphere allows me to work with brilliant minds to create tangible impact. Committed to civic engagement, Rice Design for America is a hub of social scientists, designers, and programmers ready to partner the local community to come up with useful solutions to everyday challenges. I know my Rice experience will hone my unconventional mind and provide a platform for my ideas, strengths and energy, paving the way for me to live a life extraordinary.
