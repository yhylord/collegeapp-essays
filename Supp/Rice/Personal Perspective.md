My first conversations with my parents might confuse you as much as me. When I talked with my dad, I spoke Mandarin. With my mom, I spoke Cantonese. When I talked with both simultaneously, I would pause to pick a language first. It was so bizarre only because, though understanding both Mandarin and Cantonese, they preferred speaking one particular langauge, and I, adapting to their speech, learned two native languages. However, I often worried about using the wrong one, and hesitation ensued.

After I moved to Guangzhou and entered elementary school, language switch was less usual, yet another kind of hesitation continued. Worse, it grew into anxiety. "You sound so weird," a girl laughed when I tried to strike up a conversation in Cantonese. Maybe I had mixed Mandarin into it. Maybe I carried an accent from another town. Regardless, for the first time, how I spoke was wrong, and she was not an exception, but rather a representative of "real" Cantonese. In contrast, my parents' pride in my bilingualism was merely a bias toward their son. Since then, I tended to avoid speaking Cantonese outside of home, yet whenever I activated my Cantonese tongue, self-consciousness struck, "Do I sound weird?"

My funny Cantonese bothered me less gradually, partly because my enhancing English skills compensated for my feeling of inadequacy. Eventually I got into an international school and actively participated in Mr. C's English class. I enjoyed answering questions from the charming native speaker, despite a sense of unsafety that accompanied: Did my accent bother him? Yes, the ghost of insecurity lingered on and haunted me even in another language. Pretending to be pro-active, I asked if he had suggestions on my accent.

"Actually you just sound right to me," he seemed surprised under his characteristic smile, and I was surprised too.

I felt even more astonished after I knew Mr. C's personal story. Moving to New York from the southern US, he had to adjust his accent to sound clear, but neither he nor New Yorkers had wrong accents. "They are simply different."

Since that conversation, I have lifted my ban of Cantonese at school and enjoyed my uniqueness among my friends who only speak Mandarin. Though some Cantonese still believe that I am a bit off, I acknowledge the benefit of being able to speak the language, whatever flavor it is. When I was chatting with a local cleaner in Cantonese, she was relieved that some kids still used it in a school where so many did not. I feel the bond of language again after being alienated for so long.

Finally accepting my mother tongue brings me more than another linguistic choice. It has taught me that some of my quirks are not to be embarassed of, covered, or fixed. I should be proud of them in that they tell a distinct story of myself and gift me with a special perspective that enables new connections. They are not fears. They are meaningful. They make what I am.
