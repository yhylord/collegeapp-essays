Conversations with my parents when I was younger were confusing. It wasn't just about the content (which was confusing in its own way), but how we communicated. When speaking with dad, I spoke Mandarin, and with mom, Cantonese. When speaking to both, a bizarre situation occurred where I would have to switch between both. This resulted in hesitation and awkward situations at times.

After I moved to Guangzhou and entered elementary school, the need for language switching was no longer as common, but this awkwardness had turned into anxiety of a different sort. "You sound so weird," a girl laughed when I tried to strike up a conversation in Cantonese. Maybe I had unconsciously mixed some Mandarin into my speech. Or perhaps it was my accent. Regardless, for the first time, I realized my speech was somehow "wrong" and not representative of "real" Cantonese. My parents' pride in my bilingualism was merely a bias toward their son. Since then, I avoided speaking Cantonese outside of home, and whenever I do, I would self-consciously think, "Do I sound weird?"

Gradually, my "funny" Cantonese bothered me less, partly because my growing English skills compensated for my feeling of inadequacy. Eventually I got into an international school and actively participated in Mr. C's English class. I enjoyed engaging in dialogue with this charismatic native speaker, despite a lingering sense of unease: Did my accent bother him? Yes, my insecurity had persisted and even haunted me in another language. Trying to disguise this fear as a pro-active learning attitude, I asked if he had suggestions on my accent.

"Actually you sound just right to me," he seemed surprised that I would ask, even while smiling genially. I was surprised he would think so, but understood better after I heard Mr. C's personal story. Moving to New York from southern US, he had to adjust his accent to communicate better, but neither he nor the New Yorkers had 'wrong' accents. "They are simply different."

Since that conversation, I have lifted my ban of Cantonese at school and learnt to take pride and pleasure in my cultural heritage. Though some Cantonese still believe that I am a bit off, I appreciate being able to speak the language, whatever the flavor, and do not let my feelings of insecurity get in the way. When I chatted with a cleaning lady in Cantonese, she was relieved that some kids still used it as increasingly, youngsters did not feel the need to. A common language bonded us despite our numerous differences.

Finally accepting my mother tongue brings me more than another linguistic choice. It has taught me that some of my quirks are not a cause of embarrassment, neither do they need to be fixed. I should be proud of them as they tell a distinct story of myself and gift me with a special perspective that enables new connections. They need not trip me up, and they can be meaningful. They make me who I am.
