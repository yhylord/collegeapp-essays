"We made it!" I jumped up excitedly when the text "Vote Count: 1563" showed up on the administration panel. Through our online voting system, visitors could share their favorite moments during our school's Internation Day. Their individual votes formed pithy bar charts understood by all. When I recalled the hard work that went into this, I felt a strong sense of accomplishment. Coordinating with school staff, working with team members, planning for the worst, all our efforts had paid off. Similar 'live' polls for other school events like the Christmas performance and book sale echoed this sentiment. These successes can only come about through effective leadership and robust engineering, which the School of Engineering can further develop in me. Its rigorous academic offerings and the RCEL Certificate Program will equip me with both the hard and soft skills needed to be an engineer and leader in my field of work.
