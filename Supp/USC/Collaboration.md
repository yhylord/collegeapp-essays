__Prompt__: While scientists yearn to discover the world that exists, Engineers and Computer Scientists seek to create the world that never was.  Our faculty and students believe collaborative teams are the key to great accomplishments.  Please describe a time in your life (academic, co-curricular, or otherwise) where you had to collaborate to accomplish more than you could alone. (250 word limit)

"Our goal is to discover anomalies that lead to extraordinary new materials," said Professor Washington. The exhilaration I felt listening to this was in stark contrast to the exasperation I felt penning assignments.

"Why am I so ineffective in communicating my ideas?" I asked frustratedly in our weekly catchup.

"Well, 'a picture is worth a thousand words,' so if you send me three 300-word emails, you'd be better off by sending me a picture instead," said the Professor wittily.

His good humor amused me, and I began incorporating diagrams into my emails. Colorful lines zigzagged on the white background, as if to trace the change of elusive molecules. Over time, my increasingly informative graphs reduced my essays to sticky notes, and my findings became intriguing cases that begged investigation. Professor Washington could now provide powerful insights, and I could also pose more interesting questions. Visualizing my thoughts required me to focus on their essence and their simplest presentation, which resulted in a more intuitive expression of my understanding.

The surprising benefit reminded me of Einstein's quote, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." If even my professor could not understand my point, how well could I see it myself? I learned that effective communication with others requires a thorough examination of my own ideas and a minimally effective representation of them. Reflecting on the low efficiency has shaped me into a collaborative researcher ready to examine and share his findings professionally.
