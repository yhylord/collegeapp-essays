__Prompt__: Successful students at Johns Hopkins make the biggest impact by collaborating with others, including peers, mentors, and professors. Talk about a time, in or outside the classroom, when you worked with others and what you learned from the experience. (_300-400 words_)

"Well, 'a picture is worth a thousand words,' so if you send me three 300-word emails each week, which sum up to 900 words, you'd be better off by sending me a picture instead," said Professor wittily.

The humor amused me at the other end of the screen, which was the second time I felt so happy from the beginning of the program. "Our goal is to discover anomalies that lead to new extraordinary materials," said Professor Washington from his home at West Point. The exhilaration on day one was so unreal, compared to the burnout I had staring at my essay-like email and the short, confused reply. Sometimes, I wondered if entering an international research program was right for me, not to say studying the magic-sounding field of computational quantum chemistry; sometimes, I just doubted if I could write clear English. It seemed like rather than discovering quantum anomalies, I was discovering anomalies in myself. Frustration led to my question on the reason of my ineffective communication. Having the answer, I felt a different thing reading my sent emails. They were not informative enough to deserve their lengths, the exact opposite of a beautiful graph that contained a story in itself.

Knowing the difference, I began incorporating diagrams into my emails. Colorful lines zigzagged on the white background, as if to trace the change of elusive molecules. Over time, my graphs were increasingly informative and largely reduced my essays to sticky notes. My findings became intriguing cases that begged for investigations. While Professor Washington now could give insightful doctor's certificates that addressed the discovered abnormalities, I was also able to pose questions that were more interesting. Visualizing rather than verbalizing my thoughts gave me a more intuitive perspective that allowed out of the box thinking. The surprising benefit reminded me of Einstein's quote, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." If I could not let Professor see the picture, how well could I see it myself?

Today, whenever I am illustrating a point, I always remind myself about the lesson I learned: Intuition is more powerful than intellect, and communicating with others effectively requires communicating with oneself effectively first. Just like how quantum anomalies can lead to better materials, by reflecting on the anomaly in my communication, I discovered a better self of a collaborator, be it a researcher or a general problem solver.
