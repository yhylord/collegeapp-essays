**Prompt**: Successful students at Johns Hopkins make the biggest impact by collaborating with others, including peers, mentors, and professors. Talk about a time, in or outside the classroom, when you worked with others and what you learned from the experience. (*300-400 words*)

"Our goal is to discover anomalies that lead to extraordinary new materials," said Professor Washington from his home at West Point. The exhilaration I felt listening to this was in stark contrast to the exasperation I felt penning assignments.

"Why am I so ineffective in communicating my ideas?" I asked frustratedly in our weekly catchup.

"Well, 'a picture is worth a thousand words,' so if you send me three 300-word emails, which sum up to 900 words, you'd be better off by sending me a picture instead," said the Professor wittily.

His good humor amused me, and I began incorporating diagrams into my emails. Colorful lines zigzagged on the white background, as if to trace the change of elusive molecules. Over time, my graphs were increasingly informative and largely reduced my essays to sticky notes, and my findings became intriguing cases that begged investigation. Professor Washington could now provide powerful insights that addressed the discovered abnormalities, and I was also able to pose questions that were more interesting. Visualizing my thoughts required me to focus on their essence and present it in the simplest way. The goal of intuitive communication therefore resulted in a more intuitive expression of my understanding.

The surprising benefit reminded me of Einstein's quote, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." If even my professor could not understand what I was trying to convey, how well could I see it myself? The quote summarized the lesson I learned: effective communication with others requires a thorough examination of my own ideas and a minimally effective representation of them. Reflecting on the low efficiency of my communication thus has shaped me into a more collaborative researcher. It has taught me necessary skills with which I can refine my original thoughts and deliver them in an accessible way. Professor Washington was my first audience, but it can be the general public one day, who more than ever require access to complex science that can be simply presented. My strengths in the communication and display of information can strengthen the impact of my ideas as well as those of others, and enable me to contribute to Johns Hopkins University's mission of pioneering research and contributing to society. Through fruitful conversations with my professor, I have taken the first step toward a meaningful connection with academia and the University's vision: "Knowledge for the world."
