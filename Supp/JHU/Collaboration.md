__Prompt__: Successful students at Johns Hopkins make the biggest impact by collaborating with others, including peers, mentors, and professors. Talk about a time, in or outside the classroom, when you worked with others and what you learned from the experience. (_300-400 words_)

"Our goal is to discover anomalies that lead to new extraordinary materials," said Professor Washington from his home at West Point. The exhilaration on day one was so unreal, compared to the burnout I had staring at my essay-like email and the short, confused reply. Sometimes, I wondered if entering an international research program was right for me, not to say studying the magic-sounding field of computational quantum chemistry; sometimes, I just doubted if I could write clear English.

"Why am I so ineffective in communicating my ideas?" I asked frustratedly in our weekly Zoom meeting.

"Well, 'a picture is worth a thousand words,' so if you send me three 300-word emails each week, which sum up to 900 words, you'd be better off by sending me a picture instead," said Professor wittily.

The humor amused me at the other end of the screen, and I began incorporating diagrams into my emails. Colorful lines zigzagged on the white background, as if to trace the change of elusive molecules. Over time, my graphs were increasingly informative and largely reduced my essays to sticky notes, and my findings became intriguing cases that begged for investigations. While Professor Washington now could give insightful doctor's certificates that addressed the discovered abnormalities, I was also able to pose questions that were more interesting. Visualizing my thoughts required me to focus on their essence and present it in the simplest way. The aim of intuitive communication therefore led to a more intuitive version of my understanding.

The surprising benefit reminded me of Einstein's quote, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." If I could not let Professor see the picture, how well could I see it myself? The quote summarized the lesson I learned: effective communication with others requires a thorough examination of my own ideas and a minimal representation of them. Reflecting on the low efficiency of my communication thus has shaped me into a better collaborative researcher. It has taught me necessary skills with which I can refine my original thoughts and deliver them in an accessible way. Professor Washington was my first audience, but it can be the general public one day, who might also understand my research with my straightforward presentation. My strengths can support the recognition of my independent thinking and foster its impact, which coincides with Johns Hopkins University's mission of pioneering research and contributing to society. Through formulating fruitful conversations with my professor and a tiny yet meaningful connection to the academia, I have taken the first step toward the University's vision: "Knowledge for the world."
