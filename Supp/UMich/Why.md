**Prompt**: Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the University of Michigan. How would that curriculum support your interests? _(100-550 words)_

As a programmer and advocate for benefiting humanity with technology, I created a personalized reading service that boosts access to high-quality articles found on social media. The project inspires me to seek foundational knowledge in computer science and apply it to exploring the field's possibilities, which motivates me to join the Engineering School, under U-M's vision of leading the next change through impactful research.

The key to a successful CS career is the ability to implement complex products that would support practical exploration in the field. To me, the foundational skill of a successful programmer is writing programs that are both correct and efficient. These two seemingly complementary goals, nevertheless, are often in conflict and require the deepest expertise in computer science, confirmed by my experience as a programming contestant who aimed at correctly implementing efficient data structures and algorithms under time limits. Therefore, the fact that the CS program sets such a high demand of both correctness and efficiency starting from introductory courses amazes me. The introductory course of "Data Structures and Algorithms," for example, is taught in C++, which offers high performance yet whose complexity causes many universities to avoid it. Implementing advanced data structures and algorithms in C++ requires me to have the deepest understanding of their theories and the best command of the language's complicated features to achieve efficiency. The course can strengthen the knowledge I gained preparing for programming contests, and I expect intensive debugging when testing my programs, the experience of which can be invaluable to the further of my project and broader career. The course will be a powerful tool in my toolbox, which, through the completion of other core courses, can become versatile and adaptable to various contexts.

However, I realize that U-M expects its students to be more than skillful programmers. Studying at this school that aims at expanding the realm of human knowledge, students will become future scholars through an array of research opportunities throughout their undergraduate years. The rich offering excites me, as I believe the application of knowledge and the journey of exploration in research are unique and integral to learning. When conducting computational quantum chemistry research on supercapacitors, despite the subject's deterring title and the intense workload, I was exposed to knowledge far beyond high school level, such as quantum mechanics and parallel data processing, through the journey full of surprises and joy. My experience reveals that accepting the challenge of exploring the unknown is much more rewarding than staying in the comfort zone. Thus, in my freshman and sophomore year, I plan to participate in the Traditional UROP and the Research Scholars Program. The former can strengthen my research skills, and the latter allows me to initiate a project, which will require me to ask right questions that lead to meaningful research. Afterward, I can continue my research experience at U-M in the SURE program. I am especially interested in Professor Narayanasamy's topic on building automated tools with machine learning that will increase the availability of computer science teaching. Its means and ends both echo with me, since I also incorporated machine learning techniques into my project, which started due to the difficulty of harnessing high-quality information tailored to personal needs. For the good of majority should be why technology exists, and applying it along the positive axis contributes to U-M's mission of enriching the future through challenging the present.
