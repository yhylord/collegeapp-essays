**Prompt**: Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the University of Michigan. How would that curriculum support your interests? _(100-550 words)_

As a programmer and advocate for benefiting humanity with technology, I created a personalized reading service that boosts access to high-quality articles found on social media. The project inspires me to seek foundational knowledge in computer science and apply it to explore the field's possibilities, and U-M’s Engineering School is ideal for that with its vision of leading the next change through impactful research.

The key to a successful CS career is the ability to implement complex products that would support practical exploration in the field. To me, the foundational skill of a successful programmer is writing programs that are both correct and efficient. These two seemingly complementary goals, nevertheless, are often in conflict and require the deepest expertise in computer science; something I can personally attest to as a programming contestant who aimed at correctly implementing efficient data structures and algorithms under strict time limits. That U-M’s CS program sets high expectations of both correctness and efficiency starting from its introductory courses impresses me. The introductory course of "Data Structures and Algorithms," for example, is taught in C++, which offers high performance yet it is often not taught at the freshman level due to its complexity. Implementing advanced data structures and algorithms in C++ requires me to have a good understanding of theory and mastery of its complicated features to achieve efficiency. The course will build on my existing knowledge, and with its emphasis on intensive debugging, will be invaluable to my project and career. It will be a powerful tool in my toolbox, which, through the completion of other core courses, can become versatile and adaptable to various contexts.

However, I realize that U-M expects its students to be more than skillful programmers. Studying at this school that aims at expanding the realm of human knowledge, students will become future scholars through an array of research opportunities throughout their undergraduate years. The rich offering excites me, as I believe the application of knowledge and the journey of exploration in research are unique and integral to learning. Despite the subject's deterring title and the intense workload, when conducting computational quantum chemistry research on supercapacitors, I was exposed to knowledge far beyond the high school curriculum, such as quantum mechanics and parallel data processing, an experience that was both joyful and surprising. I realized accepting the challenge of exploring the unknown is much more rewarding than staying in my comfort zone. Thus, in my freshman and sophomore year, I plan to participate in the Traditional UROP and the Research Scholars Program. The former can strengthen my research skills, and the latter allows me to initiate a project, which will require me to ask the right questions that lead to meaningful research. After which, I can continue my research experience at U-M in the SURE program. I am especially interested in Professor Narayanasamy's topic on building automated tools with machine learning that will increase the availability of computer science teaching. Its means and ends both resonate with me, as I have also incorporated machine learning techniques into my project, which I designed to address the difficulty of harnessing high-quality and personalized information. Technology should exist for the benefit of humanity, and wielding and developing it positively contributes to U-M's mission of enriching the future through challenging the present.
