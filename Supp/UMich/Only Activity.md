I would continue working at the programming club, because I enjoy a sense of achievement from my work that creates impact and gains recognition. My peer members and I set up a live stream for our schoolâ€™s homecoming event that provided 200 alumni from 4 countries the opportunity to interact through a live commenting system that projected comments from all attendees (whether virtual or physical) on a screen. To finance this, we launched a crowdfunding campaign that provided us with funds for a camera and networking devices, and to have excess for future activities. Those alumni who could not return home appreciated us for letting them feel at home, and the successful crowdfunding campaign spread the club's name beyond our student community.
